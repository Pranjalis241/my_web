        <!-- <h2>Java Framework</h2> -->
        <p> Java frameworks are powerful tools that simplify the development process by providing pre-written code and libraries. Here are some of the most popular Java frameworks:

<h4>Spring Framework: </h4>A comprehensive framework for enterprise-level applications. It provides tools for dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and integrates well with other frameworks.

<h4>Hibernate: </h4>An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables.

<h4>Apache Struts:</h4> A framework for creating web applications. It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to separate business logic from the user interface.

<h4>JavaServer Faces (JSF): </h4>A Java specification for building component-based user interfaces for web applications. It's part of the Java EE platform.

<h4>Grails:</h4> A Groovy-based framework that simplifies web application development by providing a coding-by-convention approach.


Each of these frameworks has its strengths and is suited to different types of projects. If you have a specific project in mind, I can help you choose the most appropriate framework for it!
