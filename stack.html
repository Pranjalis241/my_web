            Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures in computer science, each with unique properties and uses.<br><br>
            
            <h3>Stack</h3>
            A stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. Imagine a stack of plates: you add plates to the top and also remove them from the top. This structure is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to reverse the order of items, such as undo operations in software, parsing expressions, and depth-first search algorithms.A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It can be visualized as a pile of plates where you can only add or remove the top plate. Basic operations include:
            
            push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
            
            pop: Remove the top element from the stack.
            
            peek (or top): Retrieve the top element without removing it.
            
            isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

           <h3>Queue</h3>
            A queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. Think of a line at a checkout counter: people are served in the order they arrive. This structure is ideal for situations where order needs to be preserved, such as task scheduling, breadth-first search algorithms, and managing print jobs.A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. It can be visualized as a line of people waiting for a service, where the first person in line is the first to be served. Basic operations include:
            
            enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
            
            dequeue: Remove the front element from the queue.
            
            front (or peek): Retrieve the front element without removing it.
            
            isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
