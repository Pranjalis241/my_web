        <h3>Core Java</h3>
        <p>Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language. Its ideal for building web applications, mobile apps, and enterprise solutions. Core Java is the foundation of the Java programming language, encompassing essential concepts and features needed for general-purpose application development. It includes understanding the basic syntax, data types, and variables, which form the building blocks of any Java program. Core Java also covers control statements like loops and conditionals, enabling developers to manage the flow of their applications. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction are central to Core Java, promoting code reusability and modularity. Exception handling mechanisms ensure robust and error-free code. The Collections Framework provides powerful data structures for efficient data management. Multithreading capabilities allow for concurrent execution of tasks, enhancing performance. Additionally, Core Java includes I/O operations for reading and writing data, and the extensive Java Standard Library offers a wide range of pre-built classes and methods to simplify development tasks. Mastery of Core Java is crucial for any aspiring Java developer.</p>
