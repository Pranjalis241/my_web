        <h3>TREE</h3>
        <p>Tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. 
           The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.</p>
        
        <p>Types of Trees:</p>
        <p> Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children (left and right).<br>
            
            Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node.<br>
            
            AVL Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one.<br>
            
            Red-Black Tree: A binary search tree with an additional property of coloring nodes red or black to ensure the tree remains balanced.<br>
            
            B-Tree: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, insertions, deletions, and sequential access in logarithmic time.<br>
            
            Heap: A special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, where the key at each node is greater than or equal to the keys of its children (max-heap) or less than or equal to the keys of its children (min-heap).
        </p>
        <h3>GRAPH</h3>
        <p>A graph can be defined as group of vertices and edges that are used to connect these vertices. A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent child relationship.</p>
        <p>There are multiple ways to store a graph: The following are the most common representations.<br>
            Adjacency Matrix<br>
            Adjacency List</p>
