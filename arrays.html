            An array is a collection of elements stored in a contiguous memory location. Each element can be accessed using an index, which is a numerical value that represents the position of the element within the array. The first element is typically at index 0.There are languages where the elements of an array are immutable. You can’t modify an array, but you can get back a new one, that has one element more (after ‘insertion’) or one element less (after deletion) for example. To prevent having to copy many elements, such an array is often implemented as a tree. This allows for sharing of huge parts of the tree between an array and a copy of that array with some simple changes.</p>

<h3>
Characteristics:
</h3>

<p>
Fixed Size: The size of an array is defined at the time of creation and cannot be changed.<br>

Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array must be of the same data type.<br>

Indexed Access: Elements can be accessed directly using their index, providing efficient read and write operations.<br>
An array is always stored in consecutive memory location.<br>

It can store multiple value of similar type, which can be referred with single name.<br>

The pointer points to the first location of memory block, which is allocated to the array name.<br>

An array can either be an integer, character, or float data type that can be initialised only during the declaration.<br>

The particular element of an array can be modified separately without changing the other elements.<br>

All elements of an array can be distinguishing with the help of index number.<br>
