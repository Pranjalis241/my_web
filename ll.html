            A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science that consists of a sequence of elements, each containing a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations; instead, each element, called a node, holds data and a pointer to the next node. This structure allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements. There are several types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, where each node points to the next node; doubly linked lists, where each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes; and circular linked lists, where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. Linked lists are particularly useful for implementing data structures such as stacks, queues, and graphs. They offer advantages over arrays in scenarios where frequent insertions and deletions are required, as these operations can be performed in constant time without the need for shifting elements. However, linked lists also have some drawbacks, such as higher memory usage due to storage of pointers and slower access times compared to arrays, as accessing an element requires traversing the list from the head node.</p>

Characteristics:
</h3>

<p>
   
    Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink in size dynamically, which is particularly useful when the number of elements is not known in advance or changes frequently.<br>
    
    Non-contiguous Memory Allocation: Unlike arrays, elements (nodes) in a linked list are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.<br>
    
    Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Adding or removing elements in a linked list is generally more efficient than in arrays. This is because there is no need to shift elements after insertion or deletion, which can be done in constant time if the node to be inserted or deleted is known.<br>
    
    Sequential Access: To access elements in a linked list, one must traverse from the head node to the desired node by following the links. This can lead to slower access times compared to arrays, which allow direct indexing.<br>
    
    Flexibility: Linked lists can easily accommodate elements of different sizes and data types, making them versatile for various applications.<br>
